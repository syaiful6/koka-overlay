# Nix Flake for Koka

This repository is a Nix flake packaging the [Koka](https://github.com/koka-lang/koka) compiler. Only a few versions defined currently.

## TODO

- Allow to build [Koka](https://github.com/koka-lang/koka) compiler from source.
- List more old Koka versions in `sources.json`.

[zig overlay](https://github.com/mitchellh/zig-overlay): The `sources.json` provided here is use the same format as zig overlay. I also almost use the same nix file. Thanks!
